Goals / Basic concepts:
	
	Design a souped up badass music player
	Load in a user’s music library
	Use MusicGraph to obtain “proper” information on the artist
	Use parameters based on artist information, genre, etc. to make a visualizer.

Users should be able to share eq’s for an artist, 

Database management:
	username
		-this is the primary key
	password
		-encrypt this with blowfish
	email
	



UI:
	Use storyboard for page arrangement, which would include:
		Settings pages for visualizer and EQs
		Media player (typical Apple music / Spotify arrangement)
